+++

I'm not handy in the slightest.

My friends are far from technical.

This is great!
We can compensate by helping each other.

I developed a complete website for my friends business, Hd Håndværk.

The business does carpentry work, specializing in flooring.

I of course used my trusty stack:
TypeScript, SvelteKit and PocketBase.

You can check it out here: [hdhh.dk](https://hdhh.dk)

Visitors can read about what services they provide,
see pictures of previous work done, and contact them
via the contact form or listed contact information.

In exchange for making this website,
I got my apartment balcony sanded and oiled.

Next they'll paint my walls.

Maybe some floor work is next?

Moral of the story is:

Help yourself by helping your friends (and other people for that matter).
