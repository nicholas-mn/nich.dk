I am currently developing an internal tool for the company I work at and found a great low-code tool called Noodl [[1](https://www.noodl.net/), [2](https://github.com/noodlapp/noodl)] to help me accomplish this.

I am in the very early stages of my development learning path (currently [learning Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/)), so Noodl was the perfect candidate for me to be able to quickly get a working product out.

You can very quickly create great web apps with visual development and custom Javascript function/script nodes for extra capabilities, if needed.

But it's not all great news, though. Noodl is an "abandoned" project. The original maintainers open-sourced the project and stopped development.

Luckily, the community came together, and now there are 2 "main" forks forging the path forward: [OpenNoodl](https://github.com/The-Low-Code-Foundation/OpenNoodl) and [Fluxscape](https://github.com/fluxscape/fluxscape).

[Fluxscape](https://github.com/fluxscape/fluxscape) is a commercial project that has a subscription service for extra capabilities.

[OpenNoodl](https://github.com/The-Low-Code-Foundation/OpenNoodl), on the other hand, is part of a non-profit foundation based in France.

I was vastly more attracted to the openness of OpenNoodl and decided to proceed with their fork. The only problem is that there is no Linux build.
Actually, let me rephrase: there _was_ no Linux build.

I decided to take things into my own hands and [created a package on the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/opennoodl), so OpenNoodl is now easily available for Arch Linux users. ðŸŽ‰

I will keep on learning the "traditional" way of web development, but OpenNoodl is just such a great tool that I definitely will keep on using for other future projects.
