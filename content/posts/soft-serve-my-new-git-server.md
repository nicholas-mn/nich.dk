Looking for a cool terminal based GitHub alternative,
which is open-source, completely self-hosted and
doesn't use your code as training data?

[Soft Serve](https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve) is the answer for you!

You can check out my instance here:

```bash
ssh -p 23231 git.nich.dk
```

I am currently only hosting my Linux .dotfiles
(it's a hidden repo, you can't see it),
and the source for the website that you're
visiting right now.

I'm planning on migrating all of my private
repositories from GitHub.

Here are some screenshots:
