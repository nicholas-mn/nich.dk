I have had 2 different gym subscriptions.
One with Fitness World (now [PureGym](https://www.puregym.dk/)) and [Sporting Health Club](https://sportinghealthclub.dk/) (SHC).

Puregym is cheaper and has more locations, but their machines suck. So I am begrudgingly with SHC currently.

Why begrudgingly?

Well, SHC doesn’t allow their members to cancel their subscription the same way they created them - one their website.

You need to send them an email.

Easy sign up, difficult cancellation.

They know that a big chunk of people will postpone sending an email in comparison to just clicking cancel on a website/app.

You can’t even downgrade your subscription to only fitness (you can choose to pay more monthly for classes).

That also needs to be an email.

Puregym actually let you cancel on their website, kudos to them.

If you take my money instantly on your website, but then need an email to cancel the subscription - **you objectively suck**.

So to Sporting Health Club and other gyms engaging in this dark pattern:

_Please don’t be an asshole and just let us cancel our subscriptions on your website. Thank you._
